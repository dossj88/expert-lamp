## Description

This application is an API for a social media web application where users can share their thoughts, and reactions to friends. You can also create a friend list. This is a backend applicaition that uses NoSQL database, MongoDB database, Express.js for routing, and Mongoose ODM to handle the large amounts of unstructured data, this includes the User, Reaction and Thought models and schemas. When the application is invoked, the server is started and Mongoose models are synced to MongoDB. 

Using Insomnia you are able to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data using the API routes. Working with these I learned how to successfully GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE all users, thoughts, and reactions. It is even possible to see how many friends a user has, as well as modify or delete the friends. During this project I learned how to successfully use and understand MongoDB and Mongoose.
